            <p>Group project where we worked on a covid tracing website clone.</br>
            <strong>The backend of the website was entirely done by myself.</strong></br>
            This project has a variety of features such as: </br></br>
            - Authentication </br>
            - Extensive mySQL usage </br>
            - Ability to mark users and businesses as potentially or confirmed covid positive </br>
            - Full lists of check in history availble for users </br>
            - Different permissions among accounts such as Government Official accounts </br>

            <p>Integrated with the NBA statistics API to create an interactive way to look at shooting stats in the NBA.</br>
               During this project I learnt much about wrangling and utilizing large amounts of data to create meaningful information.
